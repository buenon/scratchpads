  Prior to build 0.0.6, upgrading scratchpads will remove all previously created scratchpads.  
  Assuming the old extension folder was not removed yet by vscode, you can attempt to retrieve the old scratchpads from
  %USERPROFILE%\\.vscode\\extensions\\buenon.scratchpads-<OLD_VERSION>\\scratchpads\\  
  As of build 0.0.6 the new scratchpads location is
  %USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Roaming\\Code\\User\\globalStorage\\buenon.scratchpads\\scratchpads\\

    - Added a new command `Scratchpads: New filetype` for adding new filetypes to the list
- New features
    - Auto paste clipboard text into newly created scratchpads
    - Auto format document (*works if auto paste is enabled*)
    - Specify a custom scratchpads folder (*When changing folders the data will not be moved automatically*)
- Prompt for filename when creating a new scratchpad is now optional (default off)
